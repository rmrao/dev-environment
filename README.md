# Dev Environment Setup

This are config files and install scripts for a number of programs that I often use. It mostly sets up a python development environment with vim. At the moment it contains

* .bashrc
* .vimrc + ftplugin commands for vim
* .tmux.conf (tells tmux to use 256 color)
* install script for vim8 (requires sudo - vim8 needed for asynchronous linting)
* install script for tmux new version (with or without sudo)
* install script for miniconda and python3.6
