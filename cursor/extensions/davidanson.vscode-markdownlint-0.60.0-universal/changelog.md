## About release 0.40.0

Originally, this extension called into the [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) library and needed to reimplement support for shared concepts like configuration files, etc.. With this release, the extension calls into [`markdownlint-cli2`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) to perform linting. This brings complete support for everything that tool supports, including the powerful `.markdownlint-cli2.{jsonc,yaml,js}` format that allows configuration inheritance along with different rules, custom rules, and [`markdown-it` plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:markdown-it-plugin) for each directory. This change means a few things behave differently or are no longer supported:

* The default configuration (to disable `MD013`/`line-length`) is allowed to propagate into an open project even if that project has its own configuration. (This was partially true before.) To change behavior within a project (e.g., for complete consistency with CLI behavior) do so explicitly with any of the configuration mechanisms (for example, via `"line-length": true`).
* The `.markdownlintrc` configuration file is no longer used. This format was supported for consistency with [`markdownlint-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) and was only partially implemented. Any of the configuration file formats used by `markdownlint-cli2` can be used instead.
* The "Open this document's configuration" action is no longer present in VS Code. This feature attempted to determine the single configuration source for the current file, but now that configuration inheritance is supported, there may no longer be a single configuration file.
* The `markdownlint.customRulesAlwaysAllow` setting is no longer used because custom rules (along with `markdown-it` plugins, `.markdownlint.cjs`, and `.markdownlint-cli2.cjs`) are automatically loaded by `markdownlint-cli2`. To prevent running external JavaScript like this, set the new `markdownlint.blockJavaScript` configuration to `true` in VS Code's user settings.
* Custom rule paths specified by the `markdownlint.customRules` setting must begin with `./` when they are relative paths (this was previously optional).
