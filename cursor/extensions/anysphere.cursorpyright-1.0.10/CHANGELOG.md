# Cursor Pyright Changelog

## 1.0.10

-   Bump basedpyright to v1.32.1
-   Use a dedicated node interpretor by default to support larger memory limits

## 1.0.9

-   Bump basedpyright to v1.31.3

## 1.0.8

-   When in a project that has a `pyrightconfig.json` or `[tool.pyright]` section in a `pyproject.toml`, default the `typeCheckMode` to "standard" to match the Pyright and Pylance behavior.

## 1.0.7

-   Include missing typeshed fallback to fix errors with builtins, such as `str`, being undefined

## 1.0.6

-   Change the default `cursorpyright.analysis.typeCheckMode` to `off`, with warnings enabled for missing imports

## 1.0.5

-   Add a `cursorpyright.analysis.disableWorkspaceSymbol` setting to match `python.analysis.disableWorkspaceSymbol` (see https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/2236).

## 1.0.4

-   Upgrade basedpyright from v1.28.4 to v1.29.4. Detailed changes can be found [here](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/releases).
-   Fix a bug where the extension would not import settings if the setting was scoped to the language.

## 1.0.3

-   Automatically set `python.languageServer` to 'None', if it was configured with something else
-   Change default type check mode from 'off' to 'basic' for minimal type checking by default
-   Add a warning if the `diagnosticSeverityOverrides` are set in conjunction with a `pyproject.toml` file or `pyrightconfig.json` file

## 1.0.2

-   Remove dependency on Pylance
-   Add a notification if file enumeration takes too long

## 1.0.1

-   Added option to import settings from Pylance

## 1.0.0

-   Bug fixes and improvements

## v0.0.5

-   Added `cursorpyright.nodeMaxOldSpaceSize` setting. Values:
    -   **> 0** – explicit heap size in MB
    -   **0** – disable automatic `--max-old-space-size` insertion
    -   **-1** – _adaptive_ (default): the extension selects a size ≈ half your physical RAM, capped at **32 GB**.
-   The extension still skips adding the flag when you manually specify `--max-old-space-size` in `cursorpyright.nodeArguments`.

## v0.0.4

-   Suppressed the error message for when Jupyter notebooks could not be parsed and when indexing takes longer than 10 seconds

## v0.0.3

-   Added settings to customize the node arguments (`cursorpyright.nodeArguments`), environment variables (`cursorpyright.nodeEnvVars`) and executable (`cursorpyright.nodeExecutable`) used to run the Pyright process.
