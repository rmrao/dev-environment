# Claude Code Extension for VS Code

**IMPORTANT**: This plugin requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) to be installed separately. For more information, see [claude.ai/code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code).

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code) seamlessly integrates with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to enhance your coding workflow. This integration allows you to leverage Claude’s capabilities directly within your preferred development environment.

- Selection context: Selected text in the editor is automatically added to Claude’s context
- Diff viewing: Code changes can be displayed directly in VSCode’s diff viewer instead of the terminal
- Keyboard shortcuts: Support for shortcuts like Alt+Cmd+K to push selected code into Claude’s prompt
